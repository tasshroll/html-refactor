# html-refactor

## Description
Refactor existing code for Horiseon webpage to add accessibility standards for disabled people using assistive technology. Added HTML semantic tags, simplified the CSS, commented the CSS, and added anchors to id's on the page.

I learned about anchor tags, id tags, alt image text, and HTML semantics. Learned how the CSS affects the web output. 

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
